# Introduction

The workshop will present the integration between Cuda Quantum and 
Classiq.

1. Program with Classiq (in a fashion of Cuda Quantum)
2. Synthesize the circuit with Classiq
3. Output a Cuda Quantum kernel
4. Execute the kernel in Cuda Quantum
5. Visualize the kernel using Classiq

The end goal - a uniform framework where users program in Cuda 
Quantum and benefit from Classiq's enhancements:

- Utilize algorithmic information above gate level to reduce 
  circuit operations
- Releasing and reallocating qubits
- Selecting between equivalent implementations

The framework will combine the Cuda Quantum programming model, 
compilation, and execution with Classiq library, synthesis, and 
visualization: Step 1 will be replaced by programming with Cuda 
Quantum.

Therefore, the workshop will focus on Classiq's library, synthesis 
and visualization and less on the programming.
