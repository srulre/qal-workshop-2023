# Introduction

The workshop will present the integration between CUDA Quantum and 
Classiq.

1. Program with Classiq (in the fashion of CUDA Quantum)
2. Synthesize the circuit with Classiq
3. Output a CUDA Quantum kernel
4. Execute the kernel in CUDA Quantum
5. Visualize the kernel using Classiq

The end goal - a uniform framework where users program in CUDA 
Quantum and benefit from Classiq's enhancements:

- Utilize algorithmic information above gate level to reduce 
  circuit operations
- Releasing and reallocating qubits
- Selecting between equivalent implementations based on 
  optimization criteria

The framework will combine the CUDA Quantum programming model, 
compilation, and execution with Classiq library, synthesis, and 
visualization.

Therefore, the workshop will focus on Classiq's library, synthesis 
and visualization and less on the programming.
